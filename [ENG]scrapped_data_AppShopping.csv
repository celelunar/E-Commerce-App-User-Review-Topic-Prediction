However it is difficult to share links/photos of products in the chat easily which maies negotiating tedious. The bigger problem is that the app has trouble connecting after viewing products so i cant chat or sent images and i have to close the app and reopen it. Since this is the main function for me it becomes very cumbersome to use.,Alibaba

Then the suppliers will message you saying their prices have increased, the items are out of stock or shipping costs more. If you don't want to pay the increase, you cancel the order. Guess who refuses to refund the transaction fees. You might think this happens sometimes. Nope. So far it's been 33% of the orders I've placed. SCAM!",Alibaba
Indah Ludji,4,2021-01-24 15:04:29,"So it started when the app notified me to update it. I tried many times but no to avail. Then, I tried to reinstall it. Now, I cannot install the app. Idk what's wrong with it, but please fix the app. Thanks. Edited: After trying for almost 20x and trying the troubleshooting suggestions on Google play, I was finally able to install the app. Thanks. One suggestion though, and I had already conveyed that via the help feature before. Now that the Wishlist has been moved to the account page rather on the home page, users need to click twice to get to their wishlist. This is kinda annoying. Meanwhile, there are two shopping chart icons on the home page, which is redundant, imo. I was wondering if it would possible to bring back the wishlist to the homepage. Perhaps, by deleting one of the shopping chart icons (the one on the bottom toolbar, if I may suggest). Thanks.",Tokopedia

Disappointing and eroded my trust in them. Sorry 1 star. Update: 24th Jan- item is still on sale. Clearly case of not honoring the offer? No?Support says delay processing& slow update. Really,Zalora
